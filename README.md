### `Ganache`

Ganache is a personal Ethereum Blockchain used to test smart contracts where you can deploy contracts, develop applications, run tests and perform other tasks without any cost. Further it also provides you with 10 temporary accounts with fake 100 ETH which can be used for testing your DAPP.

You can download Ganache in your system through this [link](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet than interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. It is available as a browser extension.
